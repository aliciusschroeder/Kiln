# T06_S01_Document_Implementation_Approach

## Description
Create comprehensive technical documentation capturing the implementation approach for Kiln's AppImage integration based on findings from T01-T03 research, T04 PyInstaller modifications, and T05 validation testing. This documentation will serve as the technical foundation for S02 AppImage integration work and establish patterns for future Linux packaging development.

The documentation must follow Kiln's existing patterns and provide practical technical guidance for implementing AppImage support, including specific code changes, configuration files, and integration points with the existing build system.
